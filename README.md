This project estimate ologit (and oprobit) models of health state transition
probabilities using a combined MEPS+HRS dataset so that the entire lifecycle
can be tracked.

The estimates are based on predictions from ologit (oprobit) models and the
Long and Freese (2014) SPost13 Stata commands are used heavily.
